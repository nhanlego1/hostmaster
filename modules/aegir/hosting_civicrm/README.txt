Hosting CiviCRM
===============

This module provides tools to manage CiviCRM [1] in the Aegir Hosting System
[2]. In other words, it will handle the installation of CiviCRM, generate the
civicrm.settings.php file, handle upgrades, manage the CiviCRM crons and the
CiviCRM API site key, and so on.

Installation
============

As of version 3.2, this module has been included in the Aegir distribution, as
part of the "Golden contrib" initiative. As such, it is automatically available
to be enabled without the need to deploy any code.

* In Aegir, enable CiviCRM and the CiviCRM cron queue from the "Hosting" options (under "experimental" options).
* Create a platform with [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/download/list) located in sites/all/modules/ (or in an install profile)
* In Aegir, add the platform inside Aegir (Node -> add -> platform)

When new sites are created in the platform, provision_civicrm will detect that CiviCRM is available and will automatically install it.

For convenience, a "drush make" makefile is available in drush/civicrm.make which can be used to generate a platform for you.

Debugging
=========

If you are having problems running the crons, try:

  drush '@hostmaster' hosting-civicrm_cron --items=5 --debug --strict=0

Patches and testing
===================

You can send a patch attached to an issue on drupal.org [11] or send a
pull-request on Github [12].

Pull-requests are not required, but have the added benefit of being tested
automatically [13] against most CiviCRM versions that are supported.

Credits
=======

Initial development was by Mathieu Petit-Clair [3] during the CiviCRM code
sprint in San Francisco of spring 2010, with the help of Deepak Srivastava [4]
who wrote the CiviCRM drush module.

Maintenance and development was then continued by Mathieu Lutfy [5], with the
help of many contributors [6] and with great support from the CiviCRM core team
and community. Front-end components were later added by Christopher Gervais [7].

Ongoing development and maintenance by Coop SymbioTIC [8], Praxis Labs Coop [9]
and Ergon Logic Enterprises [10].
